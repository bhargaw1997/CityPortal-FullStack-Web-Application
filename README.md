# CityPortal-Web-Application
This Project approaches the design and development of a System that combines the technologies with the implementation of a City Portal System. The main idea behind the development of this system was to build a System that would focus entirely on a particular city and would provide the ultimate guide of that city. Many existing systems are there but they are not so user friendly and doesnâ€™t focus on all modules of the entire city.

As Cities are turning into Smart Cities there was a need to make a system that can be used to not only focus on a particular City but can even Change Cities as per requirement and can provide the guide about a city. The city portal will provide various type and variety of information like City News, Places of Tourist Interest, Festivals, History, Cinemas, Daily Happenings, Business Directory, Online Local Store, Local Transportation Details, Real Estate and many more.

I have added all important modules in our System So that even a Naive Person can get the guide that he or she intends to get from the System easily. This system is having an Online Local Store from which a user can buys goods from nearby Local Store. Idea behind this was to promote the local store in online business and earn maximum profits to them.

The application also has Local Transportation System guide that provide all details related to local transport that exists in particular cities. Apart from this, there are various modules like the Events module, Business directory etc.

The application has Progressive web Application (PWA) for mobile device.

Please refer CityPortal Report for more details.
